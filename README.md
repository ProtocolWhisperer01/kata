# KATA

##### All of the py files are from the practice I did on code wars <h5><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">link here</a></h5>

##### Details about each kata should be in the comments in each file, also some code are updated after viewing better solutions, nevertheless the initial code will only be commented out.
